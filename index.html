    <h2>Welcome to my website project!</h2>
    <p>
      This is my first website and I'm planning on using it as a portfolio <br> 
      and a place to experiment and practice with web dev. Im going to use <br>
      the front page as a 'todo' list of sorts where I share what I plan <br>
      to do with my website. If your reading this, you probably know me so <br>
      please give me some ideas or feedback!
    </p>
    
    <h2>PLANS:</h2>
    <h3>Visual/Navigation/UX</h3>
    <p>
      - find a cool theme for the website (colours, fonts, art, animations)
      - different pages for different topics/information (about me, projects, plans, etc.)
      - ability to navigate between different pages containing different information (scaleable)
      - and more...
      
    </p>
    <h3>Cool Features</h3>
    - some sort of simple posting system where every piece of content I make is a 'post' that others can comment on
    - commenting on a post requires the user to have a simple account (database)
    - users can choose to be on a mailing list where an email bot send them a notification email whenever I make a new post
    - and more...
